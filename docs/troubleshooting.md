## Minimum Working Example (MWE)

For your own debugging and when asking for help, it is very useful to create a Minimum Working Example (MWE).
An MWE is a small example that reproduces the problem you are experiencing.
It should be as small as possible, but still reproduce the problem.
Often, when creating a MWE, you will find the problem yourself, and if not it will be much easier for others to help you.

For details on what a MWE is and how to create one, see [this blog on how Craft Minimal Bug Reports](https://matthewrocklin.com/minimal-bug-reports).
