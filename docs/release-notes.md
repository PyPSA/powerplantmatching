# Release Notes

## Upcoming Version

* Update Marktstammdatenregister data for Germany from [open-MaStR (February 25, 2025)](https://zenodo.org/records/14783581).
* Drop support for Python 3.9, add support for Python 3.13. Minimum required Python version is now 3.10.
* Restructure documentation and move to use `mkdocs` for a nicer user experience.
* Added [GeoNuclearData](github.com/cristianst85/GeoNuclearData) dataset as `pm.data.GND()`.
* Added [European Energy Storage Inventory](https://ses.jrc.ec.europa.eu/storage-inventory-maps) dataset as `pm.data.EESI()`.
* Added [GloHydroRES](https://zenodo.org/records/14526360) dataset as `pm.data.GHR()`.
* Updated ENTSOE, BEYONDCOAL, JRC, IRENASTAT and the Global Energy Monitor datasets to the latest versions.
* Fix in `pm.data.MASTR()` the distinction of hydro technologies and between offshore and onshore wind. Also read in storage technologies.
* Improved recognition of CHP power plants.
* In Global Energy Monitor datasets, also read entries below capacity threshold.
* In `pm.data.GCPT()`, add estimate for coal plant efficiency.
* Include mothballed gas, oil and coal power plants.
* Initially, include unit/block name in power plant name before matching.
* Added option to retain blocks for subsets of fuel types (e.g. `clean_name: fueltypes_with_blocks: ['Nuclear']`).
* For fully included datasets, add option to only aggregate units included in the matching process (e.g. `aggregate_only_matching_sources: ['MASTR']`).
* Added option for multiprocessing when aggregating units of non-matched power plants (e.g. `threads_extend_by_non_matched: 16`).
* Updating matching logic configuration.
